# About the project

Fun Drag and Drop robot. It has a built-in help which allows you to place the part near where it is supposed to be at a reasonable distance. It features an adaptative design depending on the user screen, though is not optimized in case the user decides to change the size of the screen. For it to work as expected, the user will have to refresh the page.

I hope you enjoy it!
